# Reboot-Arm 

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
Welcome to my first Artificial Intelligence project. In this project I installed VMware Workstation 16 Player on my computer, installed Ubuntu 20.04 and then configured the ROS system, and finally installed the packages for the arm.


## VMware Workstation

This program provides virtual simulation of operating systems, with the ability to install a number of operating systems on one device at the same time. The requirements of your computer must comply with the requirements required to install this program, which are: a powerful 64-bit processor, and the random memory space should be at least 1 GB RAM, 1.5 GB storage space, and 1 GB storage space for the operating system. Now that you are sure that your device specifications comply with the required specifications, you can download the program from [here](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-PLAYER-1612&productId=1039&rPId=66621) . After installation is complete, shutdown and restart your computer.

# Reboot-Arm 

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
Welcome to my first Artificial Intelligence project. In this project I installed VMware Workstation 16 Player on my computer, installed Ubuntu 20.04 and then configured the ROS system, and finally installed the packages for the arm.


## VMware Workstation

This program provides virtual simulation of operating systems, with the ability to install a number of operating systems on one device at the same time.

In the beginning, you must know the main requirements that must be available in your computer to install this program, and these requirements are as follows :

1- Availability of a 64-bit central processor.

2- Availability of either Windows or Linux operating systems.

3- Availability of enough random space for the actual computer to be sufficient to run the virtual computer operating system and the applications that will be installed on it, and the minimum requirement at this level is 1 GB RAM, but 3 GB RAM or higher is recommended for the best possible performance.

4- Availability of a 16-bit or 32-bit graphics card.

5- At least 1.5 GB of storage space for installing the Vmware Workstation application plus 1 GB for the operating system to be installed.

Now that you are sure that your device specifications comply with the required specifications, you can download the program from [here](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-PLAYER-1612&productId=1039&rPId=66621) .

After installation is complete, shutdown and restart your computer.
